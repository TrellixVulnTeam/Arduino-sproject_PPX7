# Introduction

This is a class attendance project for school, the main idea is an RFID scanner that reads students cards, then send their card's UID to a microcontroller which then do an action based on the card's data (whether it's known or unknown card for the microcontroller).
In addition to that it sends the data to a server that's connected through serial communication (USB), the server will then log on a database that the user has scanned their card and mark them as present. Below you can find an image explaining how this project works and what technologies were used.
